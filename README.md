💣 I am studying computer engineering and I believe that this learning will be my whole life.

⚙ Currently running a project using Node.JS

🌈 My interests are NLP, ML and I want to work in these fields in the future.

👓 When I don't code, my fingers can't stay away from the keyboard, writing about life is my hobby!
